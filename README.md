# Microcontrollers For Neuroscience!
This is an introductory course to teach neuroscientists how to do some useful things with microcontrollers. It uses the [Arduino](www.arduino.cc) development environment and the [Adafruit Pygamer](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pygamer/overview) board. Please support open-source hardware and software!
